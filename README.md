This is a library for my personal use, but feel free to use.
The src directory always contains the header only library, and the static_lib directory contains the static library and related files. The latest version of the library is stored in the src directory, but the static_lib directory may not contain the latest version because it is updated all at once when I have time.

I want to make this library a nascent treasure chest.
